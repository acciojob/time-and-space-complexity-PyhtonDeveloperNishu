	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, in computer science, measures how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It's a way to estimate the number of steps an algorithm will take, and it's crucial for understanding how algorithms will perform with larger datasets. This helps developers choose the most efficient algorithms for their applications. </p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> in computer science refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to solve a problem,
		which is influenced by the population size and problem dimension.
		O(1) — Constant Space: The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory that does not depend on the input size. 
		O(n) — Linear Space: The algorithm's memory usage grows linearly with the input size. 
		O(n²) — Quadratic Space: The algorithm's memory usage increases proportionally to the square of the input size.</p>
